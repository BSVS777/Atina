## 2026-08-10 — Kickoff of the SIGA + Atina integration

### AI consultation

The user asked to implement `CLAUDE_MASTER_PROMPT_SIGA_ATINA.md`: integrate
reusable functionality from `C:\Users\uyv31\src\Atina` into
`C:\Users\uyv31\src\SIGA` (the professor's/final codebase), preserving SIGA
as the architectural and visual source of truth.

### Accepted

- **Path resolution.** The master prompt references SIGA at
  `C:\Users\uyv31\src\SIGUIO\SIGA`, which does not exist. The only SIGA
  checkout on disk is `C:\Users\uyv31\src\SIGA` (a Laravel 13 + Livewire 4
  starter kit with an established hexagonal-DDD pattern under
  `src/IdentityAccess/{Role,Permission}`, RBAC, Fortify auth, and SIGA-branded
  UI, but no domain/business functionality yet). Treated as the intended
  target without asking, since it's the only project matching the
  description and no other candidate exists.
- **Schema scope** (asked the user, since it changes the shape of every
  following slice): Atina implements its "Docencia" module against a
  professor-provided, 35-table shared schema (`Docs/sistema_gestion_academica_utn.sql`)
  described in Atina's own journal as authoritative and shared across 5
  student teams. Atina only has real business logic for a small slice of it
  (teachers, academic credentials/"atestados", specialties, positions, audit
  log) — the other ~30 tables (classrooms, enrollment, course offerings,
  student requests, document management) are empty scaffolding with no
  implemented behavior. The user chose to bring only the tables Docencia
  actually uses into SIGA, not the full 35-table schema, to avoid maintaining
  dead schema for modules nobody has built yet.
- **RBAC approach** (asked the user): SIGA already has a working RBAC
  (`permissions` table with `module`+`action`+`name`, DDD `Role`/`Permission`
  CRUD, UI, and a documented seeding convention in `Docs/Guia-CRUD-SIGA-UTN.md`).
  The professor's shared schema defines a structurally different
  `permissions` shape (`name`+`description` only). The user chose to keep
  SIGA's own RBAC as-is and add the new module's permissions
  (`academic_credentials.*`) into it the normal way, rather than replacing
  SIGA's RBAC tables/DDD modules to match the professor's shape.
- Copied `Docs/Guia-CRUD-SIGA-UTN.md` from Atina into SIGA's own `Docs/` —
  despite living in Atina's repo, it documents SIGA's own CRUD conventions
  (worked example: a `Docente`/Teacher CRUD under an `Academic` bounded
  context) and is the concrete recipe this integration follows.
- Committed SIGA's untouched starter-kit files as a baseline commit before
  any integration change, then branched to `integration/atina-foundation`,
  so the diff history cleanly separates "professor's foundation" from
  "Atina integration work."

### Rejected

- Did not adopt the professor's full shared schema now (see Schema scope
  above).
- Did not replace SIGA's RBAC shape with the professor's (see RBAC approach
  above).
- Did not treat the professor's Spanish table/column names as an
  "external contract" exception to the English-only internal standard for
  the tables being ported: SIGA is not required to physically interoperate
  with the shared multi-team database (that constraint belongs to Atina's
  team), so its own copies of these tables are named in English like the
  rest of SIGA's schema.

### Corrections

Nothing to correct yet — this entry documents the kickoff, not an
implementation slice.

### Learning

The master prompt's assumed directory layout didn't match the actual
filesystem, and the schema/RBAC compatibility conflict wasn't visible until
after reading Atina's actual migrations, models and journal — worth doing a
full read of both codebases' real state before trusting a prompt's stated
assumptions, especially for a task with this much blast radius.

## 2026-08-10 — Porting Atina's Docencia module into SIGA's Academic context

### AI consultation

Implementation of the module scoped in the kickoff entry: teachers,
academic credentials ("atestados"), specialties and positions, following
`Docs/Guia-CRUD-SIGA-UTN.md`'s worked example (which literally uses
`Docente`/Teacher as its sample entity under an `Academic` context).

### Accepted

- Bounded context `Academic`, with `Teacher` and `AcademicCredential` as
  independent sibling entities (not one nested inside the other) — they're
  each their own aggregate with their own lifecycle, matching how
  `IdentityAccess` already groups `Role`/`Permission` as siblings rather
  than one containing the other.
- English names for the ported vocabulary: `Docente`→`Teacher`,
  `Atestado`→`AcademicCredential`, `Especialidad`→`Specialty`,
  `Puesto`→`Position`, `Auditoria`→`AuditLog`, `GradoAcademico`→
  `DegreeLevel` (values: diploma/bachelor/licentiate/master/doctorate —
  the Costa Rican degree ladder in English), `AnioObtencion`→`YearObtained`.
- `AuditLog` placed under `src/Shared/Audit`, not inside `Academic` —
  it's a cross-cutting concern (any future module could audit through it),
  matching how `Shared/Export` already holds the PDF/Excel exporters.
- `Teacher` has no Domain/Application layer, only a Presentation-layer
  Livewire component reading `App\Models\Teacher` directly — Atina never
  built one either (docente is explicitly a read-only external reference
  in its own design, "T3"), so this preserves that scope decision instead
  of inventing DDD ceremony around a module with no real business logic.
  `AcademicCredential` gets the full four-layer treatment since it has
  actual invariants (year range, duplicate detection) and use cases
  (register/edit with audit).
- `AcademicCredential`'s domain entity references `specialtyId` as a plain
  int, not Atina's nested `Especialidad` value object — Atina's own
  requirements doc justified that VO as a forward-looking contract for a
  catalog-comparison feature (DO-02) this integration explicitly excludes;
  without that consumer, the wrapper added indirection with no invariant
  behind it. Revisit if/when that catalog feature is ever ported.
- Authorization enforced only through `AcademicCredentialPolicy`
  (`academic_credentials.create` / `.edit`) at the Presentation boundary —
  dropped Atina's separate `PoliticaAutorizacionAtestado` domain-level
  indirection and its use-case-level re-check of the actor's permission
  list, to match SIGA's own established convention (Role/Permission use
  cases don't re-check authorization either; Policy classes are the single
  point of enforcement).
- No delete capability for `AcademicCredential` — the source requirement
  (DO-01) explicitly scoped this to create/edit only ("alta/edición, sin
  baja"); the Policy has no `delete` method and the UI has no delete
  action, rather than adding one nobody asked for.
- `academic_credentials.*` permissions added to `PermissionSeeder::MODULES`
  using SIGA's existing 7-action convention (create/view/edit/delete/
  search/export_pdf/export_excel), replacing Atina's single coarse
  `atestados.gestionar` permission — matches every other module in SIGA's
  RBAC, even though `view`/`delete`/`export_*` aren't wired to anything
  yet (view is implicitly open to any authenticated user, matching Atina's
  own design; delete and export were never built).
- Reused SIGA's existing `x-ui.data-table`/`x-ui.modal`/`x-ui.row-actions`
  Blade components instead of Atina's Flux-table Volt views, so the
  ported screens look native instead of introducing a second design
  system. The teacher's credentials sub-list intentionally does **not**
  use `x-ui.data-table` (which brings search/pagination controls that
  don't make sense for "one teacher's handful of credentials") — a
  smaller hand-built table reusing the same CSS classes instead.
- Wired the sidebar's existing "Teachers" nav item (previously a
  JS-only placeholder with no href) to the real route, following the
  exact pattern already used for Roles/Permissions above it.

### Rejected

- Did not port the ~30 unimplemented tables (classrooms, enrollment,
  course offerings, student requests, document management) from the
  professor's shared schema — see kickoff entry's schema-scope decision.
- Did not give `Teacher` create/edit/delete UI — Atina's own design
  treats it as an external reference; adding CRUD SIGA never asked for
  would go beyond what was actually validated.
- Did not add a "view" permission gate on the teacher list/profile pages —
  matches Atina's original `Route::middleware(['auth'])`-only access; only
  the credential mutation actions are permission-gated.

### Corrections

- PHPStan caught 4 real type errors during verification, all fixed:
  `orderBy()`'s direction parameter needs a literal `'asc'|'desc'`, not a
  plain `string` (`$this->sortDir`); a nullsafe `->position?->name` access
  on a relationship that's actually never null (the FK is `NOT NULL`);
  and `auth()->id()` returning `int|string|null` where the DTO expects
  `int|null` (switched to `auth()->user()?->id`, typed `int` on the model).
- The first version of the login-required-permission test for `Teacher`
  assumed a `hasPermissionTo` gate needed to exist; confirmed by reading
  Atina's actual route file that teacher access is `auth`-only, so no
  such gate was built (see Rejected above).

### Learning

Running `phpstan`/`pint` scoped to only the files this slice touched (not
the whole repo) was necessary — the pre-existing SIGA baseline already has
unrelated Pint style violations across files this integration never
touched, and running `pint --test` repo-wide would have produced a
misleading "failing" result. The pre-existing
`AuthenticationTest::test_login_screen_can_be_rendered` failure (302
instead of 200) reproduces in isolation on an untouched file and is
unrelated to this work — flagged for the user rather than fixed
out-of-scope.
